Tools and Libraries Used: 
Wireshark: Packet capturing
Python: Data analysis and scripting
dpkt: Packet parsing
pygeoip: Geolocation
Google Maps: Geospatial visualization
matplotlib: Visualization in Python
pandas: Data manipulation and analysis in Python

Steps:
Use Wireshark to capture packets from the local network.
Install Wireshark from its official website.
Store captured packets in a PCAP file.
Utilize Python for network traffic analysis.
Install the necessary Python libraries: dpkt for packet parsing.
Extract valuable data such as IP addresses from the PCAP file.
Employ pygeoip to map IP addresses to geographical locations (latitude and longitude).
Use the GeoLiteCity database for IP geolocation.
Generate a KML file with the geolocated IP addresses.
Install Google Earth Pro from its official website to visualize KML files.
Upload the KML file to Google Maps to visualize the network traffic flow.
Create Python scripts to generate reports and alerts based on network traffic analysis.
Install libraries for reporting: matplotlib and pandas.
Visualize the network topology and traffic flow on Google Maps.
